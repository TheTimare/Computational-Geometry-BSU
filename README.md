```

- Lab 2
```
Find if line segments intersects or not. Show in on the screen.
```

- Lab 3
```
Generating 10 points that moving inside convex polygo. 
Then using anlge algorithm and sector algorithm to check if they inside polygons.
Also using vectors to reflect points from sides of outer polygon.
```
- Lab 4
```
