### Labs Descriptions:
- Lab 1
```
Just find is point either left or right to line. And show it on the screen.
```

- Lab 2
```
Find if line segments intersects or not. Show in on the screen.
```

- Lab 3
```
Generating some points that moving inside convex polygon. 
Then using anlge algorithm and sector algorithm to check if they inside polygons.
Also using vectors to reflect points from sides of outer polygon.
```
- Lab 4
```
Generating some points and then show animation of Grahams(+ Andrews improvements)
algorithm of convex hull building.
```
- Lab 5
```
Generating some points and then show animation of Jarvis algorithm of
hull generating while points is moving. Also display diameter of the flat set.
```
- Lab 6
```
Generating some points and then show animation of Quick hull algorithm of
hull generating while points is moving.
```
- Lab 7
```
Constantly generating points and build dynamic convex hull around them.
```
- Lab 8
```
TODO
```
- Lab 9
```
Calculating min distance in a set of points by "Divide and Conquer" 
algorithm. Also movement of circles and their collisions.
